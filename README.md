# privacy-lab-workflows
This repository contains example workflows that illustrate how privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) can be used to protect users' PII within a common digital advertising use case: attribution measurement for advertising campaigns. The example workflows are informed by the IAB Tech Lab [Attribution Data Matching Protocol (ADMaP) specification](https://iabtechlab.com/admap/).

The example workflows considered in this repository are enumerated below.

* Privacy-preserving aggregation of conversions with [*k*-anonymity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-anonymity)
* Privacy-preserving aggregation of conversions with [differential privacy (DP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy)
* Matching encrypted user PII and filtered aggregation of conversions with [homomorphic encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption)
